# JavaScript Loose Equality Bug

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to loose equality (`==`) comparisons, particularly when dealing with `null` values.  The bug arises from JavaScript's type coercion during loose equality checks, leading to unexpected results.

## Bug Description
The provided code uses loose equality (`==`) to compare a variable with `null` and `0`. While logically `null` and `0` are distinct, loose equality treats them as equal in certain contexts, potentially causing unexpected behavior.

## Solution
The solution involves replacing loose equality (`==`) with strict equality (`===`) to prevent type coercion and ensure accurate comparisons. Strict equality directly compares both the value and the type of the operands.  This approach avoids unexpected behaviors from loose equality and creates more predictable and reliable code.
